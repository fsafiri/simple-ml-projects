Project Overview:
The purpose of this project was to develop an IT support chatbot for an agency, aimed at assisting users with their IT-related queries and issues. The chatbot was designed to understand user inputs, predict the appropriate response, and engage in a conversation to provide helpful solutions.

Technologies Used:

Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK library
TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model
Code Structure:

Data Processing and Preprocessing:
The initial steps involve loading JSON data containing intents, tokenizing patterns, and preparing training data by creating bags of words and corresponding output labels. The NLTK library was used for word lemmatization.

Model Architecture:
The chatbot model was constructed using a neural network with a Sequential architecture. The input layer had a dense layer with a ReLU activation function, followed by dropout regularization. Additional hidden layers were added with dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The output layer used a softmax activation function to generate probabilities for each intent class.

Learning Rate Schedule:
An ExponentialDecay learning rate schedule was implemented to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training, enhancing the model's convergence.

Model Compilation and Training:
The model was compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer with the previously defined learning rate schedule. The training data (bags of words and labels) were used to train the model for a set number of epochs.

Preprocessing Functions and Response Handling:
Additional functions were defined for preprocessing user inputs, creating bags of words, checking response similarity, and predicting intent classes based on user input. The get_response function was responsible for returning an appropriate response based on the predicted intents.

Interaction Loop:
The main interaction loop allowed users to input queries. The input was processed, intent labels were predicted, and relevant responses were retrieved from the data. The conversation history was maintained to handle user input and chatbot responses.

Key Considerations:

The code integrates NLTK for text preprocessing, TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network, and various techniques for user input handling and response generation.
The choice of threshold values for class prediction and response similarity can impact the bot's performance and user experience, and these thresholds may need to be adjusted based on real-world usage.
The ExponentialDecay learning rate schedule helps optimize model training by adjusting the learning rate during the training process.
Future Enhancements:

Implement sentiment analysis to better understand user emotions and tailor responses accordingly.
Integrate more advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) for better context understanding.
Expand the dataset and add more intents to enhance the chatbot's knowledge and capabilities.
